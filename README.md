😀 Emotion Detection using FER

This project implements Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) to detect human emotions from images or video streams. The system uses a pretrained model with the FER library to classify facial expressions into categories such as:

      Happy 😊
      
      Sad 😢
      
      Angry 😡
      
      Surprise 😲
      
      Fear 😨
      
      Disgust 🤢
      
      Neutral 😐
