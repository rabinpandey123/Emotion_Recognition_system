😀 Emotion Detection using FER

This project implements Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) to detect human emotions from images or video streams. The system uses a pretrained model with the FER library and Deepface to classify facial expressions into categories such as:

      Happy 😊
      
      Sad 😢
      
      Angry 😡
      
      Surprise 😲
      
      Fear 😨
      
      Disgust 🤢
      
      Neutral 😐
      
FER(Facial Expression Recognition)

✨ Features

    🎭 Detects 7 basic human emotions from face images.
    
    📷 Works on images and real-time webcam feed.
    
    🔍 Uses FER (Facial Emotion Recognition) library for simplicity.
    
    ⚡ Fast and lightweight model with high accuracy.
    
🛠️ Technologies Used

    Python

    FER library (Facial Emotion Recognition)
    
    OpenCV (for image & video processing)
    
    Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

📊 Example Output

      Input Image:
      
      Predicted Emotion: 😀 Happy (Confidence: 65.3%)

📈 Future Enhancements

      Add support for multiple faces at once.
      
      Deploy as a Flask/Streamlit web app.
      
      Improve accuracy using deep learning (CNNs) trained on FER2013 dataset.

Deepface: FER provide the emotion only with very low confidence. Since i trained another model deepface which is used to predict the emotion along with the gender and the age of a person. It provide better accuracy than that of the FER. Here is 4 file where 2 file are used for the emotion detection through FER and remaining two are Deepface analysis as you can see.

📊 Example Output

      Input Image:
      
      Predicted Emotion: 😀 Happy, age, Gender (Confidence: 95.3%)
